siemens,step ,cannot read cpu information on module such as rated type actual type and status of the module ,module might not be configured,check the logical address of the module check the slot and the configured slot
siemens,step ,there is a problem with the connection to the receiver of the hw configuration,the online connection from the pg to the module sdb addressee could not be set up the module recognized an error with the next communications call,clear the fault in the connection change the operating mode of the module or clear the storage bottleneck on the module and then you can repeat the attempt to set up the connection in this dialog
siemens,step ,there is a problem with the connection to the receiver of the hw configuration,connection hardware is faulty eg connection cable removed,plug the cable in
siemens,step ,there is a problem with the connection to the receiver of the hw configuration,module is in the wrong operating mode,check the operating mode
siemens,step ,there is a problem with the connection to the receiver of the hw configuration,inconsistent hw configuration in the pg,"if the hw configuration is inconsistent in the pg then
 acknowledge this dialog
 correct the hw configuration in the configuration table
 restart the load function"
siemens,step ,there is a problem with the connection to the receiver of the hw configuration,when loading the system data on to the memory card this message is displayed if there are invalid sdbs in the sdb folder,delete the system data in the simatic manager and then restart the hw config
siemens,step ,internal error  station cannot be generated,the project directory is writeprotected,remove the writeprotection for the project directory
siemens,step ,internal error  station cannot be generated,the project directory is on a network drive and the connection cannot be set up,set up the connection to the network drive
siemens,step ,internal error  station cannot be generated,no more storage capacity on the target drive,delete any data no longer needed on the target drive
siemens,step ,"inconsistent hardware configuration in the
programming device",inconsistent hw configuration in the pg,in hw config analyze the hw configuration via the menu stationcheck consistency
siemens,step ,the maximum possible number of slots within all inserted slaves has been exceeded by  slots,more slaves have been configured than permitted by the master system,split the slaves across different segments if possible or reduce the number of slaves for the master system concerned
siemens,step ,internal errormulticomputig cannot have the type inhomogenous,error in hw config of first x version,add another cpu and then deleted it the cpu is then automatically set to singlecomputing again
siemens,step ,no master system is assigned to the dp slave,missing object,rightclick for popup menu select add master system and then configure the cp again as slave
siemens,step ,the address entered is already occupied ,step  has already calculated the next free address,confirm the address suggested by step  or enter a new address
siemens,step ,module cannot be inserted here you can use only dp slaves in a master system,an attempt was made to connect a device directly to the dp bus which does not have its own interface,in the hw catalog insert a hierarchy level for this device as dp slave
siemens,step ,"the number of slots of the cpu or the master
system has been exceeded or exhausted",maximum number of modules already configured,new modules can only be slotted after deleting slaves or their modules
siemens,step ,the offline configuration  differs from the hardware configuration of the plc  do you still want to continue,an external module interbus interfacing from the phoenix company was slotted,remove external module  error can be ignored
siemens,step ,an update is presently not possible in one or more step  applications at least one gse file or type file is being referenced,in the different s applications there are objects stations open in which dp slaves are used thus it is no longer possible to install new gsd or type files or even to update them,please close the station window in the hardware configuration and all other step applications such as netpro for example that could access the gsd file  the hardware configuration application remains open however without content then you can install the gsd file
siemens,step ,the gse file type file   contains syntax errors for this reason it cannot be interpreted,step v  sp does a strict check of the gsd files some are not accepted eg when the name is longer than  characters,create a backup copy of the gsd files open file eg with wordpad and edit excerpt from the file vendorname  machine factory the name is longer than the max  characters permitted correct to vendorname   xxxxx machine factory save the file and reincorporate it
siemens,step ,error during complete restart of the module,an error has occurred when attempting to start the module restart possibly not all the cpus of the multicomputing station have been started,start the module or all the modules of the multicomputing station from the simatic manager via plc and operating status
siemens,step ,error during complete restart of the module,an error has occurred when attempting to start the module restart the key switch of the cpufm is in the stop position,set the key switch of the cpufm to run or runp
siemens,step ,error during complete restart of the module,an error has occurred when attempting to start the module restart the operating mode switch of the cp is in the stop position,set the operating mode switch of the cp to run
siemens,step ,details d cannot load sdb xx,h connections are configured in your project the configuration of highxavailability s connections has changed in step  v there are individual old configurations whose system data after a change can no longer be assigned to the latest configured highavailability s connections this then leads to abortion of the download,in the simatic manager delete the system data folder in cpu  s program  blocks then regenerate the system data in netpro
siemens,step ,the maximal length of debug info max  kbyte is reached,the maximal length of debug info of  kbyte is dependent of the system and can not be added,the debug info will be increased very fast if there is a lot of accesses to data blocks we recommend in refer to the debug info to reduce the access of only few data blocks
siemens,step ,parameter can not be controlled,you are trying to control an operand whose address is outside the permitted range of the controlling cpu,comment out the relevant line in the vat
siemens,step ,parameter can not be controlled,you are trying to control an operand outside the process image for which there is no module available,it is possible to control of the operand inside the process image even if no module is slotted for the operand
siemens,step ,parameter can not be controlled,the data block db that is to be controlled is not in the cpu to be controlled the data block db is writeprotected,load the db into the relevant cpu
siemens,step ,parameter can not be controlled,the data block db is writeprotected,you have no write access to this db you must disable the readonly attribute for this db to have write access to it
siemens,step ,parameter can not be controlled,you are trying to control a periphery input pi,direct write access to an input module is not permitted
siemens,step ,parameter can not be controlled,"with the function release pq you can only control peripheral outputs
pq",direct write access to an input module is not permitted
siemens,step ,error while generating the stl source,the stl source cannot be generated eg because it exists already and is writeprotected or because there is no more memory available on the drive,generate a source with a new name or make sure that there is enough memory available for the source to be generated
siemens,step ,the displayed block cannot be monitored because it does not match the block in the cpu,this is found to be caused by a discrepancy in the time stamps between the online block and the offline block and means that the blocks are different,the programs which are generated with cfc must be downloaded from the cfc to the plc because only this loading function guarantees that the configuration data will be consistent with the plc data
siemens,step ,there are no parameter and local variable names available because there is a time stamp conflict between the interface of the block and the description of the parameter and local variable names,the description of the parameter and local variable names has a different time stamp to the interface of the opened block this is why the parameters and local variables are displayed as pseudosymbols without comments,"this conflict first arises when you open a block and interface changes made online have not been stored in the s user program offline and now the online block is being opened
interface changes made offline have not been loaded into the cpu and now the online block is being opened
the interface of a function block or udt has been changed and now the associated instance data block or the data block derived from the udt is being opened
an online block that already has a time stamp conflict is copied offline into the s user program and now the offline block is being opened"
siemens,step ,there are no parameter and local variable names available because there is a time stamp conflict between the interface of the block and the description of the parameter and local variable names,the cause for this can be an actual hardware fault or an interrupt conflict with another module,"in this case the customer can check whether the mpi led lights on the cp during this time
a possible remedy could also be to plug the cp into a different pci slot"
siemens,step ,problems occurred during the automatic generation of stl sources see details,there are protected blocks in the selection list of the stl source to be generated,remake the selection list but without the protected blocks press the details button in the error message to obtain a detailed list of the protected blocks
siemens,step ,this operation is not possible in this position,programming error,correct the code
siemens,step ,pg resourcen error by program status of a longer fb in plcsim,in step v sp with plcsim v under nt project and block were opened online this probably led to high internal use of resources,in step v sp with plcsim v do not open the project online but select the status function from the offline project setting the virtual memory to mb does not help
siemens,step ,the triggered action cannot be executed at this time check all other step  applications and exit them where necessary,the communications module is probably already being operated with other settings eg with a different transmission rate,please check the baud rate on the pgpc via set pgpc interface and the baud rate of the cpu configured
siemens,step ,the triggered action cannot be executed at this time check all other step  applications and exit them where necessary,there might be other online functions active,close any other active online functions eg by closing the relevant windows and try again
siemens,step ,the triggered action cannot be executed at this time check all other step  applications and exit them where necessary,attempt to run the firmware update of a cpu directly via step  on a cpu,firmware update is only possible via flash card
siemens,step ,system error,mixed installation,manual deinstallation of step  and s options packages
siemens,step ,system error,nt insufficient access rights,you must have at least main user access rights
siemens,step ,system error,nt main user access rights already assigned,check that the domain user with the main user rights has also been transferred into the main user group on the local computer
siemens,step ,the eprom driver cannot support the set programming interface on this computer,pc  external prommer cause of error not yet known probably a setup problem where the registry entries are not checked,"under hkeylocalmachinesoftwaresiemenssineclogdevices
there exist the directories mcdcent and mcdpg where this is the case when using an external prommer you must delete the mcdpg directory when using an internal prommer you must remove the mcdcent directory"
siemens,step ,the eprom driver cannot support the set programming interface on this computer,same message with a pg ,bad installation of step 
siemens,step ,the external prommer is not connected to the corresponding port or the power supply has been interrupted,the external prommer is not connected to the configured lpt interface,connect the external prommer to the configured lpt
siemens,step ,the external prommer is not connected to the corresponding port or the power supply has been interrupted,the power supply of the external prommer is interrupted,reestablish the prommers power supply
siemens,step ,the external prommer is not connected to the corresponding port or the power supply has been interrupted,lpt on pc faulty,replace the lpt
siemens,step ,the external prommer is not connected to the corresponding port or the power supply has been interrupted,lpt incorrectly set,the lpt port must be set to epp in the bios
siemens,step ,"system error by sotbl server client
communication","when this message appears the sdos server sotblsxexe or
sotbxsxexe doesnt want to start",the files sotblsxexe andor sotbxsxexe are not available
siemens,step ,"system error by sotbl server client
communication",this server is a relatively conventional exe that receives data from the line as proxy for programs that want to go online it therefore has nothing to do with databases or  olecom   yet,sotblsxexe or sotbxsxexe are not in the search path is the server normally in  sbin or in the system directory the sbin directory is registered at setup as currentworkingdir of the applications if this doesnt work then this message might also be displayed
siemens,step ,"system error by sotbl server client
communication",what is the purpose of the server sdos recognizes four call types  of which are asynchronous so that the application can continue to run in  the case of asynchronous calls and exported if necessary there must be a proxy that constantly listens to the line and receives any data that arrives if the plc sends data directly only then can you start to store the applications again from the swapout file,remainders in the memory after manual closing of the server the server allocates shared memory the server needs approx  kb shared memory this should not be a problem nowadays
siemens,step ,"system error by sotbl server client
communication",the sdosdll attempts to start the server if this does not work then it tries again and again ,in step  v and higher the server checks whether it has the same version as the dll if not it doesnt start

siemens,step ,online the setting local address of participant is assigned,the ts adapter had the same mpi address  as another user in the mpi network,via the parameterize adapter function assign to the ts adapter an mpi address that has not yet been assigned and save it the ts adapter has mpi address  as works default setting
siemens,step ,online the selected communication driver can not be loaded file is not found,in v the pgpc interface hardware is set to none,select card
siemens,step ,online the selected communication driver can not be loaded file is not found,possibly wrong or no driver selected with windows nt,install driver or select card
siemens,step ,the version of the adapter connected does not support the bus parameters set or it is not connected to the adapter type assigned to it in the program setting the pgpc interface,probably the versions of the drivers and the pc adapter or pcmpi card are incompatible,check in the pgpc interface whether a ts adapter is addressed with the pc adapter driver also check the settings of your pg and the pc adapter informations you will find in the faq 
siemens,step ,communication to the pcts adapter is faulty,the pcmpi cable is plugged into a module that provides no power supply,connect external power supply
siemens,step ,communication to the pcts adapter is faulty,the connection between pc adapter and cpu is defective,check hardware warning pc adapter needs direct connection to the cpu since no external power supply is possible

siemens,step ,exit the application which is currently using the required port com port or usb,another application already occupies the serial interface or faulty setting of comif upon display under nt,with nt check in the control panel that standard is not set for addresses and int in the settings of the com interfaces under advanced if not remove com if and then restart the pc now com if should be newly installed with the standard option
siemens,step ,the driver for the required port is currently being used by another application another interface parameter assignment configuration may also be in use,the item direct connection has been selected in the simatic manager under options  set pgpc interface,select the item modem connection under options  set pgpc interface
siemens,step ,the driver for the required port is currently being used by another application another interface parameter assignment configuration may also be in use,after interruption of a ts connection the serial driver is still reserved by step ,close teleservice and step  then restart step  first followed by teleservice
siemens,step ,the interface ts adapter is set for a modem connection and there is no remote connection to a ts adapter,after dialing into a remote system via teleservice connection is set up the teleservice window was minimized and plc  display available users was selected and then this error message was displayed the reason is probably a bad telephone line or a connection that is too slow,acknowledge error message with ok and simply reselect plc  display available users the error should then no longer appear and the available users are displayed as long as the modem connection is still set up
siemens,step ,message from the module too few resources available,message from the plc when reading block when for example two upload processes are triggered simultaneously by  pg,start trace levelx
siemens,step ,illegal request of service,the cfb in the communications partner is in the wrong state,check the block call in the user program of the communications partner

siemens,step ,the service requested is not supported by the module,the object addressed does not exist on the module,check the addressing of the object
siemens,step ,d data error the references order is not available,when controlling by monitoring variables it might happen that when too many control jobs are sent to the cpu the cpu rejects them because its buffer is too full,acknowledge the message and reduce the frequency of the control jobs
siemens,step ,resources error d job list is too full,the variable table vat can no longer be opened although the table could be opened previously without any problems using the same program and with the same cpu probably the vat concerned has not be closed correctly in the cpu,please switch off the power supply of your cpu and then on again delete jobs no longer required for example deleting breakpoints terminating the function monitoringmodifying variables terminating the function program status you will then be able to go online again with the vat
siemens,step ,d resources error the trigger event is occupied,it is no longer possible to monitor a block this behavior is triggered by irregular termination of the process in the operating system, unplug the online cable of the cpu and wait at least  minute it is not enough to unplug the cpu just briefly  shut down your programming device and wait  minute before switching it on again a simple reboot is not always sufficient
siemens,step ,d resources error the trigger event is occupied,message from the module this function cannot be executed at the moment because the resource required is already occupied there are also too many test functions activated at the same time and the resources available on the module are exhausted,delete the jobs that you no longer need eg delete stop points close the monitorcontrol variables function close the program status function
siemens,step ,the distributed io system data block is structured incorrectly,a diagnostics address outside the address area has been specified for example win ac lite was installed,change the diagnostics address
siemens,step ,a mismatched cpu type or an internal structural error has been detected during block analysis,when evaluating the blocks an incompatible cpu type or internal structure error was detected,please check whether the type mlfb of the cpu that you have configured matches the cpu type onto which you are loading match the cpu types and reload please check that you are using the latest version of the configuration software with the latest service pack
